      <h1>Glaciers & Ice Sheets - about 2.4 Million years ago</h1>
    </div>
    <p> 
      Approximately 2.4 million years ago, Earth experienced a global decrease in temperature known as the Great Ice Age. During this time period, giant sheets of ice known as glaciers
      form over the ocean. This caused ocean levels to decrease around the world.

<div class="color">
  <div class="image-container">
    <p>
      The decrease in ocean levels caused large tracks of land that were previously covered by water to appear. These tracks of land are known as land bridges, as they often connnected previously isolated landmasses and 
      facilitated the migration of various organisms and people between continents. The most notable land bridge formed during this period was the Bering Land Bridge, connecting what are today Russia and Alaska. This land bridge was 
      important because before the formation of this land bridge, the Americas had been isolated from the rest of the world.

      continents. These people would become what we know today as the Native Americans.

      Although the natives lacked the resources to become as advanced as their western counterparts, they still developed many diverse cultures, each uniquely adapted to its environment. This was especially true for the natives
      in Southern and Central America, where large advance societies had formed.

    <p>For instance, the Inuit people of the Arctic built homes from snow and hunted seals, while the tribes of the Southwest, like the Hopi and Zuni, developed irrigation systems to grow corn in arid environments. The Plains tribes, like the Lakota and Cheyenne, became expert buffalo hunters, making use of every part of the animal.</p>

      <p>The story of America's discovery begins with Christopher Columbus. Columbus, an Italian explorer, was sponsored by the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella to find a new sea route to Asia. In 1492, he sailed west with three ships and landed in the Bahamas, marking a pivotal moment in world history. While Columbus believed he had found a new route to the East Indies, he had, in fact, arrived in what Europeans would come to call the 'New World'.</p>

Throughout the 16th century, explorers from various European nations sailed to the Americas, mapping the coastlines and making contact with indigenous peoples.      </p>

      <p>In the early 1600s, the 'New World' was still a relatively unknown place to Europeans, full of potential and mystery. It was in this context that Jamestown, Virginia, the first permanent English settlement in North America, was established in 1607. Jamestown was a commercial venture by the Virginia Company, an English firm that planned to make money by sending settlers to America to find gold and silver and by establishing a trade route to Asia.</p>

      <p>A little more than a decade later, in 1620, a group of English Puritans known as Pilgrims sailed on the Mayflower and established Plymouth Colony in present-day Massachusetts. Seeking religious freedom, these Pilgrims had a challenging start. However, with the help of local Wampanoag tribe, they were able to survive and, in 1621, they celebrated a successful harvest with a feast that would later be known as the first Thanksgiving.</p>

These would become the 'Thirteen Colonies,' including New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Each had its unique characteristics and development. Some were founded for religious freedom, others for business ventures, and still others as penal colonies.</p>

          <p>The settlers had to adapt to new environments and create sustainable ways of life. They learned to grow new crops, such as tobacco, which became a profitable export for colonies like Virginia. However, this prosperity came at a price, as settlers began to rely on the forced labor of enslaved Africans and indentured servants to cultivate these labor-intensive crops.</p>

          <p>The European settlers' arrival had profound impacts on the Native American tribes living in these areas. There were periods of both peaceful coexistence and violent conflict. While some Native American tribes traded and shared agricultural techniques with the newcomers, others resisted the encroachment on their lands, leading to a series of conflicts.</p>
