      <p> 
        At the dawn of the 18th century, the Thirteen Colonies began growing rapidly. Colonists became more adapted to the American landscape, and populations started to grow exponentially. In addition, waves of immigrants
        from England, Ireland, Germany, and other parts of eastern Europe  sought new opportunities in 
        this "New World," sparking a period of significant demographic change.

        As the American colonies expanded westward, they encroached upon territories claimed by both the French and the British. This expansion created a clash of interests, with both powers seeking to assert control over the Ohio River Valley. Additionally, the colonies' increasing population and economic vitality fueled their demands for more land. These circumstances, fueled by the competition between the French and British, ultimately culminated in the French and Indian War.

        The French and Indian War was fought between 1754 and 1763. It pitted the British and the American colonists against the French and their Native American allies (hence the name "French and Indian war"). The war resulted in British victory, leading to the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In this treaty, France ceded almost all of its territorial claims to Britain, effectively kicking France out of North America. However, the war also left Britain with a massive debt, leading to increased taxation on the Thirteen Colonies.

        By the mid-18th century, America was a rich mosaic of different cultures. The colonies had become a melting pot of English, Dutch, French, German, African, and Native American influences. These diverse backgrounds shaped a unique American society, influencing language, food, customs, and societal norms.

      <p>During this period, we also saw The Great Awakening - a religious revival that spread throughout the colonies from the 1730s to the 1740s. This movement left a profound impact on the American religious landscape, fostering an independent and personal approach to spirituality that mirrored the growing cultural autonomy of the colonies.</p>

      <p>The Enlightenment, flourishing during the 1700s, was a philosophical movement that emphasized reason, science, and individualism. Enlightenment thinkers advocated for the use of reason to challenge traditional beliefs, such as divine right and absolute monarchy. The movement had a profound impact on the colonists' political beliefs, laying the foundation for concepts such as natural rights, separation of powers, and democracy.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Because of how far away the Thirteen Colonies were from Britain, Britain's trade laws were only loosely enforced in the colonies. This developed into a system called "salutary neglect," in which the colonies 
        were given autonomy as long as they promised to remain loyal to the British Crown. However, after the French and Indian war Britain began exerting more control over the colonies, particulary with taxing the 
        colonists in order to pay for the war. These violations of salutary neglect are credited with galvanizing the colonists towards revolution.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="color">
    <div class="image-container">
      <p>In the years leading up to the Revolutionary War, Britain committed several violations of salutary neglect, eroding the relationship between the thirteen colonies and the British government. The Proclamation Line of 1763 restricted colonial expansion beyond the Appalachian Mountains, limiting their territorial aspirations. The Tea Act of 1773 imposed a monopoly on tea trade, angering colonists and undermining their economic interests. The Intolerable Acts of 1774 further intensified tensions, punishing Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party and curbing colonial self-governance. These actions infringed upon colonial liberties, fueling discontent and ultimately serving as catalysts for the American Revolution.</p>

      <p>The final decades of the 18th century were arguably the most transformative. Tensions between the colonies and Britain escalated, culminating in the outbreak of the Revolutionary War in 1775.

      <p>During the revolutionary war, the colonies knew that they needed to unite as one entity if they wanted to gain their independence from Britain. This led to the creation of the Articles of Confederation. This document created a Confederacy (a government with strong state governments and a weak federal government). This was the first government to be used by the colonies. </p>

      <p>The U.S. Constitution was drafted and ratified during the Constitutional Convention in 1787, creating a strong federal government while still preserving the rights of individual states. However, recognizing the need to safeguard individual liberties, the first ten amendments - known as the Bill of Rights - were added in 1791.</p>
